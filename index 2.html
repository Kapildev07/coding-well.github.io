    <h1>The Python</h1>
    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
        simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
        together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
        in many areas on most platforms.</p>

    <h1>What is Python?</h1>
    <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>

    <p> It is used for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Web development (server-side)</li>
        <li>Software development</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>System scripting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>IDE - </h2>
    <p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software tool that provides a comprehensive environment for
        writing, testing, and debugging code. In Python, IDEs are popular among developers for their
        productivity-enhancing features.Here are some key points about IDEs in Python:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Features: Python IDEs typically offer a range of features, such as code auto-completion, syntax
            highlighting, code formatting, debugging tools, and built-in libraries for faster development.</li>
        <li>Code Editing: IDEs provide a user-friendly interface for writing and editing Python code. They often include
            features like code snippets, templates, and intelligent code suggestions that help developers write code
            more efficiently.</li>
        <li>Debugging: IDEs come with built-in debugging tools that allow developers to identify and fix errors in their
            Python code. This includes features like breakpoints, step-by-step execution, and variable inspection to aid
            in the debugging process.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Python Syntx</h1>
    <p>Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
    <div class="square">
        <div class="text">
          <p>>>> print("Hello, World!")
            Hello, World!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
