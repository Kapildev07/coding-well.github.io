    <h1>The Python</h1>
    <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
        simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
        together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development
        in many areas on most platforms.</p>

    <h1>What is Python?</h1>
    <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>

    <p> It is used for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Web development (server-side)</li>
        <li>Software development</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>System scripting</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Python Syntax </h1>
    <p>Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:</p>
    <div class="square">
        <ul>
            <li>>>> print("Hello, World!")</li>
            <li>
                </p> Hello, World!</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line</p>
    <div class="square">
        <li>C:\Users\Your Name>python myfile.py</li>
    </div>
    <h1>Python Indentation</h1>
    <p>Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.</p>
    <p>Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python
        is very important.</p>
    <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
    <div class="square">
        <p>if 5 > 2:<br>print("Five is greater than two!")</p>
    </div>
